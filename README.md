# uselessbot
It's my first project in CPP, so basically it is a bot who respond to you with simple questions like "how are you, what are you doing?" and you can talk with. For the moment it's french but, there will be a traduction in english. Feel free to build something with it or do whatever you want. And it works only on Windows but I think you can recreat it on macOS or Linux. But the colors could not work.
